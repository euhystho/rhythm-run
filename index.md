# RhythmRun
RhythmRun is intended to be a fully functional app that runners of all experience levels can utilize throughout the duration of an endurance-based training session. Users will have the ability to upload their own personalized music playlist directly from Apple Music or Spotify, and RhythmRun will analyze, organize, and match each song’s frequency according to the user’s desired pace range. The inputted playlist will be sorted by intensity level relative to the runner’s aerobic abilities, which runners can then utilize in their day-to-day workouts. More specifically, RhythmRun eliminates the difficulties associated with not knowing the “feeling” of a certain pace range and acts as a motivational tool to encourage users to stay on track with their long-term goals, whether it be consistency or speed-oriented. Above all, RhythmRun stands as a reminder that there does not have to be a trade-off between music preference and current pace level. Instead, users will have the capacity to enjoy their favorite catchy tunes, all while ensuring productivity and safety during every race, run, jog, or fast-paced walk!

## FAQs
### General Questions:
**Q**: What does the app do?

This app helps runners create structured workouts by analyzing the BPM (beats per minute) of songs in a playlist they upload. The app will then sort the songs by intensity and create a workout playlist, allowing for a more structured, engaging, and fun workout.

**Q**: Can I use my own music?

Yes! The app will analyze the BPM of any songs the user uploads and organize them to create a workout playlist based on them.

**Q**: Will the app work with streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music?

The app’s later versions may include integration with various streaming services, but the minimum version will require uploads from local files.

### Music and Playlists:
**Q**: How does the app decide which songs to use for my workout?

The app analyzes the BPM of uploaded songs and organizes them based on intensity. For certain structured workouts, it will modulate between high- and low-intensity songs at appropriate intervals.

**Q**: What happens if my playlist doesn’t have enough songs for a workout?

The app will potentially have the ability to suggest additional songs that fit the workout criteria and are within the same genre as the already existing playlist.

**Q**: Can I edit my workout playlist after the app generates it?

Yes, future versions will include the option to reorder songs within the same BPM range, and the user will be able to add or remove songs based on workout needs.

### Workout Features:
**Q**: Does the app support different types of workouts?

The minimum version will have just one type of workout, but later versions will support more workout types and allow for customization.

**Q**: Will the app track my running statistics?

Yes, in later versions the app may use GPS or wearable devices to monitor aspects like heart rate, distance traveled, and split times.

**Q**: How will I know when the intensity is going to change?

Not in the initial version, but later versions will include voice or haptic feedback to indicate when the pace or intensity is about to change.
